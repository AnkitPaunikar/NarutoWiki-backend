# Backend Of NarutoWiki 

To run this application 

npm i 
npm start 

If you want to run these endpoints locally, you will need MongoDB setup on your machine and all the documents created on it, or you can create a JSON server.

Here is the link to all the data in JSON format: https://github.com/AnkitPaunikar/Narutodb-frontend/tree/main/src/data

This backend provides two end points 
1. /getAll/:key           -- To get all data from MongoDB ( Currently limited to Characters )
2. /update/:id            -- To update Images to MongoDB
3. /updatechardetails/:id -- To update Character Details to MongoDB
